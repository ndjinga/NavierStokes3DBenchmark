| *Cube domain* |

</center>

The domain is a regular cube.
The cube meshes consist in three families.
- uniform hexahedra  (compatible with finite difference or finite volume discretisations)  
  <img src="3DHexaÃ¨dres/mesh_hexa_2.jpg" alt="uniform hexahedra" width="100"/>  
  The meshes originate from the conference [FVCA6 benchmark](https://github.com/ndjinga/FVCA\_Meshes) in Prague, 2011.
  | | mesh\_hexa\_1 | mesh\_hexa\_2 | mesh\_hexa\_3 | mesh\_hexa\_4 | mesh\_hexa\_5 |
  | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
  | Number of nodes | 27 | 125 | 729 | 4913 | 35937 |
  | Number of cells | 8 | 64 | 512 | 4096 | 32768 |
- gentle tetrahedra (compatible with finite elements or finite volume discretisations)

  The meshes where obtained by tetrahedrisation of the Kershaw meshes from the conference [FVCA6 benchmark](https://github.com/ndjinga/FVCA\_Meshes) in Prague, 2011.
