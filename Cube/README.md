# Cube meshes
The cube meshes consist in three families.
- uniform hexahedra  ![](3DHexaèdres/mesh_hexa_2.jpg =100x100) (compatible with finite difference or finite volume discretisations)

  The meshes originate from the conference [FVCA6 benchmark](https://github.com/ndjinga/FVCA\_Meshes) in Prague, 2011.
